I was a software engineer at [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org) from 2003-2020, working on the [Gecko layout engine](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Introduction), with a focus on implementing new CSS and layout features, making architectural changes to improve speed and memory use, building tools to debug memory use and memory leaks, analyzing automated crash report submissions, general debugging and bug fixing, driving projects to successful completion, and mentoring of both junior and senior engineers in many of these areas.

I've also been a longtime participant in work on Web standards: this includes participation in the W3C's [CSS Working Group](https://wiki.csswg.org/), being an elected member of the W3C's [Technical Architecture Group](https://tag.w3.org/), longtime involvement at a technical and standards policy level in both the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) and [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/), and helping others at Mozilla interact with these standards bodies and with other companies participating in them.

The code I have on github falls into a few categories:

Proposals for Web standards:
* [**container-queries-implementability**](https://github.com/dbaron/container-queries-implementability) - Proposal for container queries designed to be implementable in web browsers (in progress)
* [**css-line-spacing**](https://github.com/dbaron/css-line-spacing/blob/main/explainer.md) - Specification of features for even spacing of lines in CSS. (in progress, though not active)
* [**css-supports-functions**](https://github.com/dbaron/css-supports-functions/blob/main/explainer.md) - Proposal for new functions for css @supports rules (now [part of spec draft](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-conditional-4/#at-supports-ext))

(building this list is in progress)
